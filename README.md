### Project 7 for Treehouse FEWD Course
----


#### Interactive Video Player


##### To Run:
- Download or clone repo
- Open index.html in browser


##### Or:
- http://twoodman.github.io/th-fewd-project-7


##### Tested In:



##### To Do:
- ✔️ ~~Embed video using HTML~~
- ✔️ ~~Check that video works in at least three modern
browsers~~
- ✔️ ~~Add transcript below video (as shown in mockup)~~
- ✔️ ~~Style page using mockups~~
- ✔️ ~~Implement play/pause buttons~~
- ✔️ ~~Add volume button - should allow you to also mute/unmute sound~~
- ✔️ ~~Implement fullscreen button~~
- ✔️ ~~Implement playback progress control~~
  - ✔️ ~~User should be able to click anywhere on playback bar to
  jump to parts of video~~
  - ✔️ ~~As video plays, playback bar should fill in~~
  - ✔️ ~~As video plays, current time should be displayed and updated~~
- ✔️ ~~Use JS or CSS to hide/show video player button on mouse over states~~
  - ✔️ ~~Only progress bar should remain~~
- ✔️ ~~As playback time changes, sentences in transcript should highlight~~
  - ✔️ ~~Use JS to listen for changes and apply highlight to appropriate sentence~~
  - ✔️ ~~Use captions.vtt file to see times at which words are spoken in video~~
  - ✔️ ~~Make sure to remove default prop on track tag~~
- Note which browsers tested on
  - 🔧 Microsoft Edge 38.14 - spans don't remove class when another span is clicked
  - 🔧 Firefox 47.0 - same as Edge
  - ✔️ Chrome 53.0
- ✔️~~Validate HTML/CSS/JS~~
  - ✔️ HTML: no errors
  - ✔️ CSS: no errors
  - ✔️ JS: no errors as far as I can tell. Gave me 'too many errors', but they were all for missing semicolons. I use the [standardjs](http://standardjs.com/) style guide, which uses no semicolons.
- ✔️ ~~Check for issues/Validate JS (JSHint)~~
  - ✔️ ~~see above!~~


##### Exceeds Expectations:
- ✔️ ~~Embed .vtt file as CC track and add button to toggle captions~~
- ✔️ ~~Creative and thoughtful responsive design. I did this by:~~
  - ✔️ ~~Keeping browser focus border rather than try and remove
  that~~
  - ✔️ ~~Making the buttons easy to click/tap (BIIIIIIIIG)~~
  - ✔️ ~~Adding a mute button?~~
  - ✔️ ~~Resetting video when it reaches the end~~
  - ✔️ ~~Making un-highlighted text faded and highlighted text dark/obvious~~
  - ✔️ ~~added helpful controls like rewind/fast forward 10 seconds~~
- ✔️ ~~Playback speed control OR other helpful controls (jump back 10/30seconds?)~~
- ✔️ ~~Add restart button for fun~~
- ✔️ ~~Volume control on viewer~~
- ✔️ ~~Playback controls include buffering progress of video~~
- ✔️ ~~When user clicks on sentence in transcript, player jumps to
appropriate time in vid~~
