  - As video plays, current time should be displayed and updated
- Use JS or CSS to hide/show video player button on mouse over states
  - Only progress bar should remain
- As playback time changes, sentences in transcript should highlight
  - Use JS to listen for changes and apply highlight to appropriate
  sentence
  - Use captions.vtt file to see times at which words are spoken in
  video
  - Make sure to remove default prop on track tag

  that~~ **done**

- When user clicks on sentence in transcript, player jumps to
appropriate time in vid
