----


#### Interactive Video Player


##### To Run:
- Download or clone repo

##### Tested In:



##### To Do:
- ✔️~~Embed video using HTML~~
- ✔️~~Check that video works in at least three modern
browsers~~
- ✔️~~Add transcript below video (as shown in mockup)~~
- ✔️~~Style page using mockups~~
- ✔️~~Implement play/pause buttons~~
- ✔️~~Add volume button - should allow you to also mute/unmute sound~~
- ✔️~~Implement fullscreen button~~
- ✔️~~Implement playback progress control~~
  - ✔️~~User should be able to click anywhere on playback bar to
  jump to parts of video~~
  - ✔️~~As video plays, playback bar should fill in~~
  - ✔️~~As video plays, current time should be displayed and updated~~
- ✔️~~Use JS or CSS to hide/show video player button on mouse over states~~
  - ✔️~~Only progress bar should remain~~
- ✔️~~As playback time changes, sentences in transcript should highlight~~
  - ✔️~~Use JS to listen for changes and apply highlight to appropriate~~
  sentence
  - ✔️~~Use captions.vtt file to see times at which words are spoken in video~~
  - ✔️~~Make sure to remove default prop on track tag~~
- Note in comments (and here) which browsers tested on
- Validate HTML/CSS
- Check for issues/Validate JS (JSHint)


##### Exceeds Expectations:
- ✔️~~Embed .vtt file as CC track and add button to toggle captions~~
- Creative and thoughtful responsive design. I did this by:
  - ✔️~~Keeping browser focus border rather than try and remove
  that~~
  - ✔️~~Making the buttons easy to click/tap (BIIIIIIIIG)~~
  - ✔️~~Adding a mute button?~~
  - ✔️~~Resetting video when it reaches the end~~
  - ✔️~~Making un-highlighted text faded and highlighted text dark/obvious~~
- ✔️~~Playback speed control OR other helpful controls (jump back 10/30seconds?)~~
- ✔️~~Add restart button for fun~~
- ✔️~~Volume control on viewer~~
- Playback controls include buffering progress of video
- ✔️~~When user clicks on sentence in transcript, player jumps to
appropriate time in vid~~
